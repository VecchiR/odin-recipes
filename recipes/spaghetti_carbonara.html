        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <h3>For the sauce</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>For the pasta</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>8 ounces spaghetti</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                    <li>4 slices bacon, diced</li>
                    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (optional)</li>
                </ul>


        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <h3>Sauce</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, Parmesan cheese, and a generous amount of black pepper. Set aside.</li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Pasta</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to package directions until al dente (usually about 8-10 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until crispy, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove the bacon from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Add the garlic to the pan and cook for about 30 seconds, until fragrant.</li>
                    <li>Immediately turn off the heat.</li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Combining</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Drain the pasta, reserving about 1/2 cup of the pasta water.</li>
                    <li>Add the hot pasta to the skillet with the garlic and toss to coat.</li>
                    <li>Working quickly, pour in the egg mixture and toss constantly until the sauce thickens and coats the pasta, about 30 seconds. If the sauce seems too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water to thin it out.</li>
                    <li>Remove from heat and stir in the reserved bacon and parsley (if using).</li>
                    <li>Serve immediately with additional grated Parmesan cheese and black pepper, if desired.</li>
                </ol>


        <h2>Tips</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>For an even richer flavor, you can use guanciale instead of bacon. Guanciale is cured pork cheek that has a deeper, more savory flavor than bacon.</li>
                <li>If you don't have Parmesan cheese, you can use Pecorino Romano cheese.</li>
                <li>Be careful not to overcook the eggs, or they will become scrambled.</li>
                <li>This dish is best served immediately, as the sauce will continue to thicken as it cools.</li>
            </ul>
